* opto limit switches, needs 5V.  Smoothie (and clones) have pullup on 1.26 lines so no extra
  pullup is needed
* The MKS SBASE board came as 3v3.  Change the pin to give it 5v
* install a limit switch on the door
* breakout board for the ribbon cable

Power supply wiring
---

The power supply has a four bin header (with xh spacing?), a 3 pin header (.1")
and two 2-pin headers (.1") along with a four pin connector for mains power
and the cable running to the laser tube.  The mains power connects to I think
the ground of the laser and powers the fan.

The four pin output header is what powers the steppers (if need be) and the main
control board.

The three pin header is used for the variable power connected to the pot.  The
PWM output from the smoothie will connect to this pin.

One 2-pin connector is for the 'laser ready' and the other is for the 'laser test'.

One two pin connector (laser ready, pushbutton hold) and the other switch to the
door are connected and can stay connected.  One is labelled (K+,K-) and the other
is (D+,D-). TODO: figure out which is which.

The PWM output needs to be connected to the 3-pin connector (G-In-V).

Important!  The current was initially set to 2.0 (A) which caused the motors
to get scorching hot and I think started melting the plastic.  Setting it
to 0.5A was still running hot.  I settled on 0.25.  It feels firm and is only
warm to the touch.

Enable the laser module (pwm) on pin 3.26:

```
laser_module_enable                          true            # Whether to activate the laser module at all. All configuration is
                                                              # ignored if false.
laser_module_pin                             3.26             # this pin will be PWMed to control the laser. Only P2.0 - P2.5, P1.18, P1.20, P1.21, P1.23, P1.24, P1.26, P3.25, P3.26
```

Enable X and Y endstops:

```
endstops_enable                              true             # the endstop module is enabled by default and can be disabled here
#corexy_homing                               false            # set to true if homing on a hbit or corexy
alpha_min_endstop                            1.24^            # add a ! to invert if endstop is NO connected to ground

alpha_max                                    200              # this gets loaded after homing when home_to_max is set

gamma_max                                    200              #
```

And make sure things don't keep going when the limit switches get hit for the min X and Y:

```
alpha_limit_enable                          true             # set to true to enable X min and max limit switches
beta_limit_enable                           true             # set to true to enable Y min and max limit switches
#gamma_limit_enable                          false            # set to true to enable Z min and max limit switches
```

Somehow the back mirror got misaligned.  I tweaked it until it worked.  The mirror is one of the cheap kind that has screws
in the positions (presumably one for X, one for Y and one for both) along with some 'holding nuts' that need to be loosened
before alignment can take place.

Things are working.  I've cut 1/8" wood (plywood?) at full power, feedrate '500'.  There are still a few issues:

* There should be better venting.  Flames periodicially come up
* The cuts are not straight.  This is most likely due to the beam not hitting the mirror square and going through
  the lens at an angle.  See ["Why Are My Laser Cut Edges Not Straight?"](http://www.buildlog.net/blog/2013/05/why-are-my-laser-cut-edges-not-straight/)
* Lower priority, but having a quick 'dry run' to get the bounds of the work would be good.

From the software side:

* Order is important.  In making medallions if you cut the outside before the inside this is obviously bad.

3.25 is the PWM pin for variable laser output.
